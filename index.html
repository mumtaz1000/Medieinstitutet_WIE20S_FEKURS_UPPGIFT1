            This week we’ll be discussing the concept of
            <strong>"Youtubability" </strong>
            - <br />
            another important game guideline.

            <h2>Youtubability</h2>
            <p>
              A key driver of youtubability is<strong></strong>
                the clarity of your gameplay</strong
              >
              to a potential player.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your
              game by working on getting
              <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong>
              for your games.
            </p>
            <p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
            <p>
              For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte- raction with the game
              is<strong> evident,</strong> for example, can she tell which
              character she<strong> controls?</strong> Is the
              <strong>objective clear?</strong>
              Does it look<strong> fun to play?</strong>
              Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
              seconds (too long!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure to <strong> use colours</strong> to help indicate the
              gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are
              <strong> clearly contrasted</strong>
              (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.
            </p>

      <p>If you want to run user tests with 
        friends and family or even random 
        people in the street, it is interesting to 
        show them the 30 second video before 
        making them try to prototype in order 
        to understand their expectations from 
        the video vs. the actual game they try.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong>
         with visual elements 
        that help <strong>understand the objective and 
          controls</strong> of the game, like with the 
        target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s 
        Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw 
        Car with the space dedicated to 
        drawing.</p>
    </div>
  <br><br><br><br>
    <div class="big-white-block">
      <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook feed, </strong>everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch! </strong><br><br>
        Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on 
        YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea 
        for your game videos.</p>
